This project is a rewrite of a previous project.  It emulates the popular dice game, Yahtzee.  This game previusly used PHP, but was converted to Javascript once I became sufficiently skilled to rewrite it.

<h3>Overview</h3>

The user clicks to roll the dice, with the interactions being detected by event listeners.  As the user fills in the scores the corresponding boxes are removed via the DOM.  Users can submit scores via AJAX which are then stored in a MySQL table.

<h3>Challenges</h3>

<dd><em>Solution</em>: This is simply achieved using the HTML DOM. (Resolved)</dd>
